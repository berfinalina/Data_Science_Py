# Data_Science_Py

In this project I use Visual Studio Code, Python Pandas & Python Matplotlib to analyze and answer business questions about 12 months worth of sales data. The data contains hundreds of thousands of electronics store purchases broken down by month, product type, cost, purchase address, order ID and more...

1. We start by viewing and cleaning our data. Tasks during this section include:

• Drop NaN values from DataFrame

• Removing rows based on a condition

• Change the type of columns (to_numeric, to_datetime, astype)



2. Once we have cleaned up our data a bit, we move the data exploration section. In this section we explore 5 high level business questions related to our data:

• What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month? 

• What city sold the most product?

• What time should we display advertisemens to maximize the likelihood of customer’s buying product?

• What products are most often sold together?

• What product sold the most? Why do you think it sold the most?


3. To address these inquiries, we navigate through a variety of Pandas and Matplotlib techniques. These encompass:

• Merging multiple CSVs to form a consolidated DataFrame (pd.concat).

• Introducing new columns to enhance data context.

• Transforming cell contents into strings for the creation of additional columns (.str).

• Employing the .apply() method for customized data manipulation.

• Utilizing groupby operations to conduct aggregate analyses.

• Crafting bar charts and line graphs to visually represent our findings.

• Adding labels to enhance the clarity and interpretation of our visualizations.
